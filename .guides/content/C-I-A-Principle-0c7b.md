In Cyber Security, there is a triad of principles that are followed to ensure trust and security of data.  The C-I-A principle refers to three goals of Information Assurance in all contexts, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Accessibility.

Confidentiality means that users other than you or users without granted access cannot read your data.  Assuring that data remains private is one of the central concerns of data scientists and cyber security experts.

Integrity assures users that the data they are receiving is their data and that it has not been accessed and altered or changed by anyone other than users with clearance to do so.

Accessibility addresses the issue of when and where to I have access to my data.  Data scientists and data warehouses can provide 24/7 access but that is more expensive than if the user will accept some amount of down time where their data is not accessible for maintenance or other routine issues.
