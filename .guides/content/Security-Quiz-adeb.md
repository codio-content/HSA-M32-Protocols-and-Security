## Security vs. Privacy
There is a constant tension between privacy, wherein people can communicate with other people without any concerns of others listening in, and security, where people who would plot against the government, plan to do harm to people, or carryout illegal acts cannot hide.

For each of the situations, decide if security or privacy are being advantaged.
