The Caesar Cipher works by taking a letter and shifting it up the alphabet.

{Run Caesar Cipher}(python Encryption/CaesarTest.py)

To decrypt the message, the same process needs to be done in reverse.  Assume that the key is 10, if we wanted to decrypt a message, we would just move every letter backwards 10 spaces.  Since we are working with a rotating alphabet, there is another way to move back 10 spaces.

Imagine you are setting the time on a clock.  The current time is ahead by two hours.  There is no button for moving the time backward, you can only go forward.  How would you set the time?
