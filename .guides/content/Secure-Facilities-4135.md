Data centers and other facilities use an array of security measures to ensure that people don't break in and steal the data directly.  With each of the measures used to increase security, it also makes it more difficult for employees and contractors to access the facility.  The cost of building such a center also increases as more security measures are installed.  

## RFID Authentication
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) consists of a reader and a card (or fob) containing an RFID microchip.  The chip contains a unique identifier, when the chip is near enough to the reader it receives a radio signal that it uses as power.  The only function of the chip is to transmit the unique identifier.

## Biometric Security
Facial recognition, finger print/hand scanners, retina scanners, these are all examples of biometric security.  Biometric refers to any part of a persons biology being used as an authentication method.  These are very difficult to re-create and cannot be left at home or in the car.

## Physical Barriers
Data centers will often only have a few access points open to vehicles.  These may have spike strips to ensure cars enter through the correct gate, removable or automated crash barriers to prevent attacks on the facility.
