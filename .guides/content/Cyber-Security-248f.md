As more of our lives are lived online, security and privacy are leading concerns.  We want to be able to save our data in a place where we can access it anytime we need it but we also want to ensure that other people cannot see our data.  Once files are not physically on your computer but stored on a server somewhere in the world, we no longer have absolute control over who sees the file.

Steps can be taken to ensure that files that do fall into the hands of someone else will not be able to be read by them.  Tools that encrypt files ensure that another person looking at your encrypted file will be unable to open or read the data.

Obviously we donâ€™t want people to be able to read our e-mail, text messages, or other data.  Therefore, encryption software is a positive thing.  There are, however, bad actors who want to do harm to others.  The government and law enforcement would like to know what these people are doing and would like access to their communication.
