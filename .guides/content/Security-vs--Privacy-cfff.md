## EMail
You use a popular web-based email system.  The service is free but there are advertisements off to the side of your email.  The advertisements are oddly specific to the content of your email and you realize that they are using an algorithm to "read" your private email to find references to products or services you might like.  The advertisements are based on the content of your email and as a result the people placing the ads are paying a premium for a target customer experience rather than blanketing every user with the same ads.
|||Challenge
How do you feel about an algorithm "reading" your email?  Is it worth using the email service or would you prefer to pay a monthly fee for a service that does not look in your email?

## Metadata
A government program is collecting all of the metadata for millions of people's phone calls.  This data includes your approximate GPS location during the call, who the call was to, the duration, and the time of the call.  While the actual content of the call, the things you said, was not recorded, the metadata is stored in a data center for possible future use.  
|||Challenge
How do you feel about this?  Is this an invasion of privacy if no actual message content is being shared?  How might that metadata be used to increase security and catch potential criminals?

## Secrecy Applications
Many applications both for computers and phones allow users to send an encrypted message that is so secure it cannot be decrypted by anyone but the intended recipient.  As a result, criminals have begun to use these channels to thwart police and intelligence agencies attempts to eves-drop on their plans.
|||Challenge
Should these type of applications be banned because of their potential use by criminals?  Do they provide a service for people who have nothing to hide?  Should creators of such apps have a backdoor so that a message heavily suspected to contain information that could put lives in danger could be opened by law enforcement?  What is the potential downfall of such a backdoor?
