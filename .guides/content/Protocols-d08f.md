A protocol is an agreed upon set of rules for computers to communicate.  You may have protocols for how you answer the phone, “Hello”, or how you ask to use the restroom during class.  Unlike those examples, computers cannot adjust if the protocol is a bit off.  For example you could answer the phone and say “yes” and the human on the other end would know that is the equivalent of “hello”.

Computers use protocols for all of their communication.  For example Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) are all examples of a set protocol computers use to send web pages, files, or e-mail.
